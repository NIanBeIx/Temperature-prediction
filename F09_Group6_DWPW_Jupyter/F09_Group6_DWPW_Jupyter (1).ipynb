    "The conventional thermometer takes approximately more than 100s to be able to reach quasi-thermal equilibrium with the water bath. In order to reduce the time taken, a linear regression model that takes into account the heat capacity and thermal conductance is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Governing Equation, Tsensor = A(exp(-time/tau)) + Twater, where tau is the time constant and is determined through dividing the heat capacity by thermal conductance, and A is (Troom - Twater); Troom is the room temperature, assuming it is the initial temperature the temperature senses.\n",
